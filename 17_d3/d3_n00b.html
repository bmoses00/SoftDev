<!--D3 demo: hardcoded bars removed, to be generated fr data-->
<!--
    Can yield a horizontal bar chart if properly bound to data
    (steelblue bars, white number overlays)
    ...but will yield only blank page at first.

  .chart div {
  font: 10px sans-serif;
  background-color: steelblue;
  text-align: right;

<!--------------------------------
    Entering the following commands via console will
    incrementally re-create your hardcoded chart...

    //Init your data:
    var data = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];

    //Select your chart.
    var chart = d3.select(".chart");

    //Prepare for data join.
    var bar = chart.selectAll("div");

    (this defines selection to which you will join data)

    //Join your data.
    var barUpdate = bar.data(data);

    //Instantiate new elements by appending to the “enter selection.”
    var barEnter = barUpdate.enter().append("div");

    //Set width of each bar proportional to its data value.
    barEnter.style("width", function(d) {
    return d * 10 + "px"; });

    //Label each bar.
    barEnter.text(function(d) { return d; });
  -------------------------------->

  <!--
Observations:

d3.select looks very different from the regular getElementById
Comparing them, d3.select gives the chart variable a '_parents' field,
and a 'groups' array which contains another array storing div.chart.

bar has no divs inside, which makes sense considering chart doesn't
have any divs. It only has an empty NodeList.

not sure what bar.data does, or bar.data(data) for that matter. data
isn't a field of bar, and it isn't a function, so I don't how this
works. It creates an object which has an array of 6 empty elements.

barUpdate.enter() puts something in the arrays and makes them not
empty, an rt {ownerDocument...} which contains the '__data__' element,
corresponding to elements from the data array.

barUpdate.enter().append("div") makes each of the elements contain a div,
and each of the divs has a '__data__' element within, corresponding to the
element from the 'data' array.

the next two commands, using parameter 'd', which corresponds to the __data__
element, format the bars.
