- thoughts on treemap example:

  - .text() function, as you might expect, adds text
  - attributes like clip-path, x, y, do what they sound
  like they should do, not sure about fill-opacity
  - most of it still seems like magic, there are so many
  functions that I'm not familiar with like .ancestors(),
  .uid(), leaves()

- chart funcitonality seems pretty simple and powerful,
fairly customizable
