1:

Since each td element has an event listener for the 'clicky' function and that function
gives an alert for that element's innerHTML, we think that clilcking on a td will give
a popup for its text.


2:

We're not sure whether the innermost (td) or outermost (table) will trigger first. Mr.
Mykolyk said in class that events travel down from root, but working with 13_svg the
innermost event triggered first, so we think the order is td -> tr -> table.


3:

When stopPropogation() is triggered, the propagation of events will stop and only the
innermost event will trigger.

Our thought was incorrect: we missed the 'true' parameter on the table's event listener,
which made it so that the table's event triggered first, before the elements beneath it.
So only the table event listener triggered.


4:

We don't think that the order of attachment matters, because to our knowledge the rules
governing order of triggering are only based on level in the DOM.
